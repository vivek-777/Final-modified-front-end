# **Face Expression Recognition(FER)** 


## Getting Started
Facial image based mood detection techniques may provide a fast and practical approach for non-invasive mood detection. 
This project is based on Face Expression Recognition (FER) techniques which include the three major stages such as pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. 
The purpose of the project is to develop an intelligent system for facial image based expression classification using neural networks.

Facial expressions and related changes in facial patterns give us information about the emotional state of the person and help to regulate conversations with the person. 
Moreover, these expressions help in understanding the overall mood of the person in a better way.

Our second objective of the project is to provide valid user authentication to an online test conducted by several platforms like AMCAT, CO-CUBES in this we will authenticate that whether the valid candidate is giving the paper or not.
